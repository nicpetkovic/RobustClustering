# RobustClustering
A "similarity-based robust clustering method" implementation.

Why ?
Neither Scipy nor Sckit_learn have such a method. Which is a powerful tool to estimate a cluster when:
1) no assumptions hold on the given set
2) robustness to outliers is needed

multi class still have some bug to fix !!!
